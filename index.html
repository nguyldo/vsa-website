            <p>
                The Vietnamese Student Association at Purdueâ€™s mission is to 
                increase the cultural awareness and promotion of Vietnamese 
                culture on campus, within the midwest, and across the nation. 
                Our membership comes together to implement social, cultural events, 
                while encouraging a multimedia medium.  We provide these opportunities 
                for Vietnamese as well as non-Vietnamese individuals who are 
                interested in experiencing Vietnamese culture, heritage, 
                and tradition.
